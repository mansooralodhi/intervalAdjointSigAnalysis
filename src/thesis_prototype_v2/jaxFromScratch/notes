Terminology
-----------

infix operators: add, mul, neg
primitive operations (atomic processing units): sin, +, -

Concepts
--------

- "Transform" -> interpret differently
  Instead of standard interpretation where we apply primitive operations to numerical inputs to produce
  numerical outputs, we want to override primitive application and let different values flow through our
  program.
  Moreover, we want to be able to compose multiple transformations, leading to stacks of interpreters
